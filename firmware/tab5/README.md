# `firmware/tab5/`: the touchscreen application

This folder will hold the firmware that turns the M5Stack Tab5 into the portable front panel of
the RISC-V computer. Read this page for a short overview; the full design is in
[TAB5_FIRMWARE.md](../../docs/TAB5_FIRMWARE.md).

> [!NOTE]
> **Status: 📋 PLANNED.** This folder holds only a `.gitkeep` placeholder. No firmware has been
> written, built or flashed, and the owner's exact Tab5 model and revision are ❔ **NOT
> VERIFIED**. Status labels are defined in the [root README](../../README.md#2-project-status).

## 1. What it will do

The M5Stack Tab5 is an ESP32-P4 device with a 5-inch 1280 × 720 touchscreen and microSD. The
firmware will:

- load programs from microSD;
- show the CPU's console output;
- drive the FPGA's debug hardware: halt, resume, step, breakpoints, registers, memory, trace,
  performance counters, self-test and fault injection.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is a **controller and observer**. The ESP32-P4 never runs the RISC-V programs being
> demonstrated; those always execute on the FPGA. Anything that is not live hardware data is
> labelled on screen.

| Badge | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **LIVE** | Just read from the connected FPGA |
| **CAPTURED** | A frozen hardware snapshot, shown with its age |
| **HISTORICAL** | A stored earlier result, such as an old benchmark |
| **MOCK** | Simulated data for UI development; never mixed with real controls |

---

## 2. Framework

| Choice | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **Native ESP-IDF + FreeRTOS + LVGL**, with one board-support layer matched to the actual device revision | The framework |
| Arduino with M5Unified/M5GFX | Allowed only as an isolated bring-up experiment |

Exact versions are pinned only after the real device passes milestone T0.

## 3. Planned module structure

The diagram shows the firmware layers, from the screens at the top to the board hardware at the
bottom. Each layer only calls the one below it.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    UI["ui/<br/>LVGL screens, touch, labels"] --> STATE["state/<br/>connection, CPU, operation state"]
    STATE --> DEV["device/<br/>CPU control, memory, loader, captures"]
    DIAG["diagnostics/<br/>BIST, injection, reference compare"] --> DEV
    DEV --> PROTO["protocol/<br/>typed commands, sessions, retries"]
    PROTO --> TRANS["transport/<br/>UART, COBS, CRC, queues"]
    DEV --> STOR["storage/<br/>microSD manifests, reports"]
    TRANS --> BOARD["board/<br/>display, touch, SD, UART pins"]
    STOR --> BOARD
```

Task ownership:

- One task owns UART I/O and packet processing.
- Worker tasks do file and device operations.
- Only the UI task touches LVGL objects.
- Touch callbacks never block on serial or file access.

## 4. Screens and when they become real

| Screen | Enabled at |
| --- | --- |
| Home, Programs, Terminal, System | T1 as MOCK; T5 live |
| CPU Control, Registers, Memory | T3–T4, then STEP and breakpoints at T6–T7 |
| Pipeline, Trace | T8, verified pipeline only |
| Performance | Baseline at T5, full at T9 |
| Diagnostics, Fault Injection | T10, T11 |
| Reference report | T12 |
| Presentation / About | T1 static; verified actions at T13 |

## 5. microSD layout

These are example paths, not files that exist:

```text
/programs/<name>/manifest.json
/programs/<name>/program.bin
/expected/<test-id>/reference-data
/reports/<run-id>.json
/reports/<run-id>.csv
```

---

## 6. Build and recovery

> [!NOTE]
> 📋 **PLANNED.** No build commands are documented yet because no SDK version has been validated
> on the real device. The target chip is the ESP32-P4.

At implementation:

| Goes into Git | Stays ignored (already in `.gitignore`) |
| --- | --- |
| Source, `CMakeLists.txt`, component manifests, `sdkconfig.defaults`, board profile, dependency lockfiles, local assets | `build/`, `managed_components/`, `sdkconfig` |
