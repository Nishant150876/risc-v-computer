# Requirements and verification matrix

This matrix maps every section of the original [Tab5 specification](TAB5_REQUIREMENTS.md) to the
milestone that delivers it and the test that will prove it. Use it to check that nothing in the
specification is forgotten, and to see what evidence a gate needs before it can be ticked.

> [!NOTE]
> **Status: 📋 PLANNED.** Every row maps a requirement to future proof. No Tab5 test in this file
> has run. Core CPU testing (unit tests, rv32ui, lockstep) is described in
> [How we test](BUILD_PLAN.md#8-how-we-test) and [tb/README.md](../tb/README.md); this matrix
> covers the 35 sections of the [Tab5 specification](TAB5_REQUIREMENTS.md).

## 1. How traceability works

Each requirement flows through a milestone and a test package into a recorded result:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    R["REQ-nn<br/>a section of the original spec"] --> M["Milestone<br/>T0-T13 or a core phase"]
    M --> V["V-* work package<br/>the tests that prove it"]
    V --> E["Gate evidence record<br/>commands, hashes, results"]
```

| Word | Meaning | Today |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Covered** | The requirement has a milestone and defined proof. | Every requirement is covered. |
| **Met** | That proof exists as an evidence record and passes. | None is met. |

**Status.** All implementation and hardware evidence below is **planned**, not passed. The
repository has a skeleton, design documents and a passed Phase 0 (the
[counter smoke test](PHASE0_SMOKE_TEST.md), the test runner, the scripted blink build and CI);
none of that satisfies any of the Tab5 acceptance requirements below.

Where the details live:

| Topic | Document |
| --- | --- |
| Milestone definitions and dependencies | [BUILD_PLAN.md](BUILD_PLAN.md) |
| Debug architecture and contracts | [TAB5_INTEGRATION.md](TAB5_INTEGRATION.md) |
| Wire protocol | [DEBUG_PROTOCOL.md](DEBUG_PROTOCOL.md) |
| Firmware | [TAB5_FIRMWARE.md](TAB5_FIRMWARE.md) |
| Hardware, wiring and power | [HARDWARE_CHECKLIST.md](HARDWARE_CHECKLIST.md) |

---

## 2. Complete proposal traceability

`REQ-nn` matches section nn of the original specification; each ID links to that section. These
are coverage links, not completion checkboxes.

> [!WARNING]
> A passed simulation does not substitute for the indicated hardware evidence.

## 3. Verification work packages

These are planned test identities, not filenames or scripts already present.

- Implement meaningful assertions and keep expected behavior independent of the block under test.
- Extend the existing runner, `scripts/run_tests.py`; it already builds and runs every
  `tb/**/*_tb.sv`.

### Core regression

| ID | Scope | Cases / invariant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| V-CORE | Original core regression | Unit/directed/rv32ui/lockstep pass after each debug integration; stores and non-register-writing instructions checked. |
| V-IDLE | Debug has no unintended CPU effect | Same deterministic program with debug disabled, idle, and read-only observation: same retirement/store/output sequence; measure any declared observation stalls. |

### Link, bus and ownership

| ID | Scope | Cases / invariant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| V-LINK | Packet codec and sessions | All bytes, zero/max payload, CRC vector, bounds, malformed/truncated frame, recovery, timeouts, lost ACK, duplicate/stale/ID conflict, session reset/wrap. |
| V-WB | Bus bridge | Byte-to-word address conversion, SEL, ACK/ERR exclusive, wait states, stable request, one side effect, watchdog, uncertain write, invalid decode. |
| V-OWNER | RAM ownership | CPU/DEBUG/BIST never overlap; no owner switch mid-transfer; instruction port held; reset/disconnect/abort cannot grant access prematurely. |

### Execution control and state

| ID | Scope | Cases / invariant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| V-HALT | CPU control | Halt during each stage and pending memory operation; no lost/duplicated store, drained acknowledgment, stable regs, correct next PC, reset domains. |
| V-STEP | Architectural step | Exactly one instruction for NOP, x0 destination, ALU, load/store delays, branch both outcomes, JAL/JALR, hazard, ECALL/EBREAK and error. |
| V-BREAK | Pre-execution break | No selected instruction side effect; older branch redirects cancel wrong-path match; repeated loop PC and one-use bypass make progress. |
| V-STATE | Register and memory | x0, all registers, byte/half/word, sign/byte ordering, boundaries/overflow, write/readback, no MMIO dump, generation freshness. |

### Loading and console

| ID | Scope | Cases / invariant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| V-LOAD | Manifest and loader | ISA/ABI, file/path/bounds/BSS/stack validation, corrupt/reordered/missing chunk, readback CRC, invalid image cannot run, reset/disconnect, A-to-B no bitstream change. |
| V-CONSOLE | Console isolation | Binary console resembling packets is data; debug commands never become program input; queues bounded, overflow visible, replayed reads do not consume twice. |

### Observation

| ID | Scope | Cases / invariant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| V-SNAPSHOT | Coherent captures | All stage/counter values from one epoch, valid/flush consistency, stale labels, snapshot during branch/halt, CDC review if domains differ. |
| V-TRACE | Retirement history | No bubbles/flushed records, store ordering, circular wrap, low order-bit wrap, freeze at whole record, bounds, missing-record detection, disassembly against encodings. |
| V-PERF | Event counters | Defined active/wall/halted time, exact branch/stall/flush counts, 64-bit rollover/carry, atomic latch, interval reset, CPI zero denominator and configured clock identity. |

### Diagnostics

| ID | Scope | Cases / invariant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| V-BIST | Hardware self-test | Scratch/full-RAM ownership, March phase order/results, actual ALU under test, independent vectors, injected faults detected, abort cleanup, image invalidation. |
| V-FAULT | Controlled corruption | Default disarmed, exact address/bit/trigger/duration, original/changed/readback values, read-path injection during BIST, no neighboring changes, restoration after failure. |
| V-REF | Offline comparison | Equal initial state, independent expected behavior, registers/next PC/stores, deterministic MMIO policy, first proven mismatch, incomplete trace inconclusive. |

### Firmware and standalone system

| ID | Scope | Cases / invariant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| V-UI | Firmware/UI | MOCK/LIVE/CAPTURED/HISTORICAL labels, capability/state gating, mode switch preserves state, touch response during load/SD errors/disconnect, memory/stack bounds. |
| V-BOOT | Standalone hardware | Flash configuration, both boot orders, SD failures, program validity, reset/reconnect, laptop/monitor absent, ten P1 and twenty P2 cold boots. |
| V-POWER | Physical/reliability | Correct revision/pins/logic levels, no back-power, current margin, brownouts, bank auto-off, cable/strain/thermal review, measured runtime. |

## 4. Gate evidence record

For every passed gate, record the fields in the template below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a test fails, keep the failure and reproduction rather than replacing it with a screenshot
> of a successful UI button.

Template for one record, using exactly the required fields:

```text
Gate / milestone:        e.g. Phase 1 or T2
Requirement / test IDs:  REQ-nn, V-xxx
Command or procedure:    exact command line or manual steps
Source snapshot:         commit hash
Build hashes:            FPGA bitstream, Tab5 firmware
Tool / driver versions:  Verilator, Vivado, GCC, ESP-IDF, ...
Hardware:                board revisions, power source
Seed / trial count:      ...
Expected result:         ...
Observed result:         ...
Artifact paths:          logs, reports, captures
Known limits:            ...
```

| Coverage level | Complete when |
| --- | --- |
| **Planning coverage** | All REQ-01 through REQ-35 have an owner milestone and defined evidence. |
| **Implementation coverage** | Those evidence records exist and their underlying behavior passes. |

No measured CPU performance, power/runtime, BIST coverage, timing closure, or portable hardware
success is claimed by this planning pass.
