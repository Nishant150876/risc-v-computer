# Tab5 firmware and user-interface plan

This is the design for the touchscreen application on the M5Stack Tab5: which framework it uses,
how its modules and tasks are split, which screens it has, and how programs are stored on
microSD. Read it before writing anything in `firmware/tab5/`.

> [!NOTE]
> **Status: 📋 PLANNED.** Framework selected; no firmware written. The owner's Tab5 revision is
> ❔ NOT VERIFIED, so no SDK, dependency, toolchain or driver version is pinned or validated.

## 1. In plain terms

| Term | What it is | Its job here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ESP-IDF** | Espressif's official SDK for its chips, including the Tab5's ESP32-P4 | Build system, drivers for UART, SD card and display |
| **FreeRTOS** | A small real-time operating system bundled with ESP-IDF | Runs several **tasks** at once, so a slow SD read never freezes the screen |
| **LVGL** | A graphics library for embedded touchscreens | Draws the screens, buttons and lists; handles touch |
| **BSP** | Board support package | Knows how this exact Tab5 revision wires its display, touch and SD card |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The golden rule of the design: the touchscreen must never wait on the FPGA.** Slow work
> happens in background tasks that report back through queues.

---

## 2. Framework decision

**Use native ESP-IDF + FreeRTOS + LVGL**, with one revision-compatible Tab5 board-support layer.
This gives:

- separate transport/storage/UI tasks and bounded queues;
- reproducible configuration;
- an offline application without a browser/server.

Board support is an interface, not permission to assume a particular display revision.

### Candidates compared

| Candidate | Evidence and tradeoff | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ESP-IDF, LVGL, compatible official BSP/board bindings | Espressif publishes a Tab5 BSP with LVGL/display/touch/SD support. Its listed controllers do not establish compatibility with every newer Tab5 revision. | **Selected production direction**; exact BSP/driver combination must pass T0. |
| M5Stack factory ESP-IDF/LVGL application | Official M5Stack source provides real device initialization and build/recovery references. It is a hardware example, not our diagnostics application. | Reference board bindings and recovery behavior; preserve licenses for any reused code. |
| Arduino + M5Unified/M5GFX | Official M5Stack libraries support Tab5 and offer a short display/touch/peripheral bring-up route. A second production stack adds duplicated builds and behavior. | Optional isolated T0 smoke experiment if useful, not a competing final firmware. |

Sources reviewed November 6, 2026:

- [Official M5Stack factory source](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Tab5-UserDemo)
- [M5GFX](https://github.com/m5stack/M5GFX)
- [M5Unified](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Unified)

> [!NOTE]
> The factory README names an ESP-IDF version for its example; that is evidence of that example's
> build, not an automatic version pin for this project.

### What T0 must do before any version is pinned

1. Identify the actual display/touch controller.
2. Build an appropriate vendor-supported sample.
3. Test display, touch, SD and UART together.
4. Record exact ESP-IDF, BSP, LVGL and driver versions/commit IDs, lockfiles, configuration
   defaults, licenses and recovery steps.
5. If the chosen BSP does not support the actual revision, use compatible official board bindings
   or a documented driver adaptation before continuing.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not flash an assumed panel configuration and call the device validated.

## 3. Modules and task ownership

Planned home: `firmware/tab5/`. Do not create an enormous application source file.

| Component | Responsibility / concurrency boundary |
| --- | --- |
| `board/` | Display, touch, SD, power-status and UART pin bindings for the verified revision. |
| `transport/` | UART driver/events, bounded RX/TX queues, COBS/CRC codec, resynchronization. |
| `protocol/` | Typed commands, session IDs, replay-safe retry policy, capability discovery. |
| `device/` | Asynchronous CPU control, memory/register operations, loader, captures, counters. |
| `storage/` | microSD manifest validation, file streaming, expected traces, atomic report export. |
| `state/` | Connection state, CPU state, operation state, image/capture generations and stale timestamps. |
| `ui/` | LVGL screens/components, touch actions, navigation, status labels and local assets. |
| `diagnostics/` | BIST/injection workflow, reference comparison and structured results. |

### Who runs what

The diagram shows the three kinds of task and the bounded queues between them. Only the UI task
touches LVGL.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    UI["UI task<br/>only task that touches LVGL"] -- "commands" --> Q1[["bounded command queue"]]
    Q1 --> W["worker tasks<br/>device ops, file I/O"]
    W -- "packets" --> Q2[["bounded TX/RX queues"]]
    Q2 <--> IO["UART I/O task<br/>framing, CRC, retries"]
    IO <--> FPGA["FPGA debug UART"]
    W -- "immutable state snapshots" --> Q3[["UI message queue"]]
    Q3 --> UI
```

| Task | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| UART I/O task | UART I/O and packet processing |
| Worker tasks | File and device operations |
| UI task | All LVGL objects, updated from messages carrying immutable state snapshots |

**Task rules:**

- Keep LVGL callbacks short; no blocking serial reads, sleeps, full program transfers, or SD scans
  in touch callbacks.
- Keepalive/status work must remain scheduled during large transfers.
- Use bounded buffers rather than repeatedly allocating whole image/trace files.

### The device layer

- The device layer provides request/accepted/progress/completed/error callbacks.
- An operation ID is not a successful result.
- UI navigation does not cancel a hardware action implicitly; explicit cancellation follows the
  hardware cleanup contract.
- Update the application model only after verified device responses.

---

## 4. States, capability checks, and data provenance

### Three state machines

Track three independent state machines: connection, CPU, and operation, as defined in the
[protocol](DEBUG_PROTOCOL.md#capabilities-and-state-machines). The top bar always shows:

- connection health;
- current hardware identity;
- execution state;
- the age of displayed data.

### Provenance badges

| Badge | Meaning | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **LIVE** | Just read from the connected FPGA | The only badge for current hardware behavior. |
| **CAPTURED** | A frozen hardware snapshot | A frozen pipeline capture includes cycle, generation and trigger. |
| **HISTORICAL** | A stored earlier result | An old benchmark is historical even if the FPGA is connected now. |
| **MOCK** | Simulated data | T1 may use mock data with an unmistakable persistent MOCK badge; do not expose real mutation controls through a mock backend. |

After disconnect, retain data only with an explicit stale label.

### Capability checks

- Discover FPGA capabilities before enabling an operation.
- A disabled control should explain the relevant missing capability or state.
- An unimplemented hardware command cannot be simulated behind a button while claiming LIVE.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The FPGA remains the authority on permission/state; UI checks are not the only protection for
> register edits, BIST, or fault injection.

### Demo Mode and Engineering Mode

- Demo Mode and Engineering Mode are views of the same application state and protocol.
- Switching views does not reset the FPGA, lose the loaded program, or change register state.
- Destructive actions require an explicit operator confirmation and explain the affected
  memory/program, as required by the brief.

## 5. Screens and initial availability

### Display and responsiveness targets

| Item | Target |
| --- | --- |
| Display | The verified 1280×720 landscape display orientation |
| Layout | Large touch targets, readable hex values, consistent spacing and restrained animation |
| Refresh budget | Start with a 5 Hz status/counter refresh |
| Touch feedback | An initial target of 100 ms, to be measured at T1/T5 |

Measure frame responsiveness while transferring an image, streaming console text, and running
diagnostics.

### Screens

| Screen | Content | Enable milestone |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Home | Identity, link/CPU/program state, configured clock, PC labels, summary counters and launch shortcuts. | T1 MOCK; T5 LIVE. |
| Programs | Local manifests/descriptions, verify/load/run/stop/restart with bounded progress. | T5. |
| Terminal | Genuine CPU output, scroll/clear, bounded text buffer and optional input; overflow visible. | T5. |
| CPU Control | HALT/RESUME/RESET, last-retired/next PC; later STEP and breakpoint slots. | T4 then T6/T7. |
| Registers | x0–x31 plus ABI names, hex/decimal/binary views, changed-register highlight and halted edits. | T4; step highlight at T6. |
| Memory | Bounded RAM address viewer, words/bytes/ASCII, explicit edit/readback; no automatic MMIO dump. | T3 reset-held; T4 halted. |
| Pipeline | Coherent IF/ID/EX/MEM/WB captures, valid/bubble/stall/flush labels and capture age. | T8, verified pipeline only. |
| Trace | Frozen retirement records, supported RV32I disassembly, register/store effects, loss/generation information. | T8. |
| Performance | Atomic counters, interval CPI, event definitions, historical comparison and export. | Baseline T5; full T9. |
| Diagnostics | Real memory/ALU BIST, PASS/FAIL/ERROR, range/case counts and first failure. | T10. |
| Fault Injection | Target/mask/trigger, one-use arm/fire, original/observed value, detection and cleanup. | T11. |
| System | Device/protocol/build versions, capability list, communication errors, actual power status where available. | T0/T2 then T5. |
| Presentation / About | Locally stored one-minute explanation, ownership of FPGA/firmware design and short/deep guided sequences. | T1 static; verified actions T13. |
| Reference report | Expected versus actual retirement, earliest proven mismatch and surrounding complete trace. | T12. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The final presentation may render program-generated graphics or input on Tab5, but the
> simulated world/game/algorithm must run on the FPGA. If a screen only illustrates architecture,
> label it as an explanation rather than a cycle capture.

## 6. microSD content and image validation

Use a simple local layout, with generated binaries prepared on the development computer. Example
logical paths, not files already supplied:

```text
/programs/<name>/manifest.json
/programs/<name>/program.bin
/expected/<test-id>/reference-data
/reports/<run-id>.json
/reports/<run-id>.csv
```

### Manifest schema version 1

| Group | Fields |
| --- | --- |
| Identity | Name, description, program/build identifier |
| Target | ISA `rv32i`, ABI `ilp32` |
| Image | Binary path, byte count, load/entry address, CRC-32 |
| Layout | BSS bounds, stack bounds |
| Requirements | Required FPGA capabilities |

- Initial constraints and memory reservations are in the
  [architecture document](TAB5_INTEGRATION.md#7-program-images-loading-and-launch).
- A development-side packaging tool should generate metadata from the actual ELF/linker output,
  not ask an operator to type checksums or guess BSS bounds.

### Validation and loading rules

1. Validate before LOAD_BEGIN, then let the FPGA independently validate bounds and readback.
2. Stream chunks instead of copying every program into UI RAM.
3. Disallow path traversal and oversized/missing files.

**Switching programs.** Switching from A to B clears the prior program's console/counter
baseline only at defined launch boundaries, while preserving historical reports with their own
image hashes.

**SD failures:**

- Missing/corrupt SD yields a clear recoverable state; static About and status screens still
  work.
- Use temporary report files then rename after successful write.
- Report removal/full-card errors without blocking the UI.

## 7. Reproducible builds and recovery

### What goes into Git at implementation

| Commit | Keep out of Git (ignored) |
| --- | --- |
| Source, `CMakeLists.txt`, component manifests, `sdkconfig.defaults`, board profile, dependency lockfiles, local fonts/assets, documented SDK version | Generated build files, managed component downloads, local `sdkconfig`, compiled firmware |

> [!NOTE]
> A lockfile is source configuration, not generated clutter to discard.

### What to document

- Clean environment setup and the `esp32p4` target.
- Actual USB/serial port and build/flash/monitor steps.
- Supported boot/recovery procedure and partition layout.
- Restoring a known-good image.

Keep a tested recovery path even after the unit auto-starts the app. No Wi-Fi/cloud service is
required for runtime. Do not install a second production toolchain merely for a prototype
screen.

### Host tooling

- `host/` will provide the Python protocol client and deterministic preparation tools for
  development/testing.
- Declare any serial dependency when introduced; do not borrow the unrelated project's Python/uv
  restrictions.
- Host tooling is optional during the final portable demonstration.

---

## 8. Firmware verification

Test codecs and application state independently of LVGL/hardware. Use a fake transport only in
explicit MOCK mode.

Exercise:

- unsupported capabilities;
- late replies, duplicated/reordered messages;
- connection loss during loads;
- SD removal/full card;
- control navigation during long operations;
- queue overflow;
- recovery when either device resets first.

Validate live behaviors against FPGA tests rather than just screen appearance. At gates, record
measured responsiveness, heap/stack use, protocol errors, and actual hardware/driver versions.

**Next step:** the first firmware milestone is
[T0](BUILD_PLAN.md#t0-identify-and-bring-up-the-actual-tab5), which starts with the
[hardware identification record](HARDWARE_CHECKLIST.md#2-t0-identification-record).
